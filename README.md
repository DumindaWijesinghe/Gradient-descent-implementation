Gradient descent implementation in numpy 

Let’s implement gradient descent in python, using only numpy.

In a previous article we discussed about two series of numbers ([1,2,3,4,5],[3,6,9,12,15]) and an artificial neuron figuring out the relationship between them. This article intend to implement the analogy we discussed there.

## Cost function
Cost function and it’s derivative with respect to w and b is as follows.
